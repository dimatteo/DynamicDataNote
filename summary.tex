The amount of resources needed for the CMS computing system will grow significantly as we are approaching the 
beginning of LHC Run-II, and the CMS computing management is now proposing to make best use of our infrastructure by employing a 
novel way of managing the data distribution.

In this document, we have summarized the fundamental ingredients of the new Dynamic Data Management system, in particular
we have focused on the MIT HEP computing resources, where a simplified prototype of such a system has been already set in place.

We have introduced the MIT HEP Dynamic Data, and summarized its core structure, functionalities and scope.
Examples of the good performances of our system have been reported, as well as live pages where any user can access and 
evaluate our product. 

Our experience with this new way of data managing is overall extremely positive and we think that other sites might as well 
benefit from it, and eventually that this will lead to an improved usage of the CMS computing resources.
